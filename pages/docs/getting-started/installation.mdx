Installing KGen is quite simple as long as you have Node.js installed. If you have Node installed, jump to [Installing KGen](#installing-kgen) instead.

## Installing Node.js

If you havn't installed Node.js yet, head over to [Node.js downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install using their pre-built installer.

The minimum version of Node.js KGen requires is `v16.15.1`. Please check your installed Node version using:

```bash
$ node -v
```

Older versions of Node.js may not be supported.

## Installing KGen

KGen can be installed through the default node package manager `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install -g @kgen/cli
```

The CLI should be available after running the command above. To test your installation, run:

```bash
$ kgen version
```

At the time of writing, the latest version of KGen is `v0.0.6`. Your versions may vary by time.
